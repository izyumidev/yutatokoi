- Thought it would be good to write about it, since it is a need of mine that is kind of unique
- Sleep at 21:00, wake up at 06:00. 9 hrs
- I barely function with less than 7.5 hrs
- My brain forces shut down by midnight basically no matter what I'm doing, even if I'm having fun with friends
- So please don't get offended or try to make me stay up, since I'm not able to go without sleep for as long as most other people.

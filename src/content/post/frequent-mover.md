## How can one move 11 times over 20 years?

I recently turned 20 years old, but have moved 11 times, and attended 10 different schools/institutions. It gets quite messy detailing all the moves, but in short, my parents' jobs and the unique circumstances around my undergraduate degree are the reasons why I move at a pace of more than once every two years.

Here's a list of all the countries I've lived in:
- Japan
- Singapore
- Malaysia
- U.S.A
- Australia

I especially moved very frequently during elementary school. At times I thought my dad was a spy and my mom an assassin[^1].

## How this has shaped me

This frequent moving during upbringing seems to be quite unique, and I feel it's played a large part in shaping who I am.

My interest in Math and minimalism likely stem from this. Through moving around different countries, not being able to speak the language, being unfamiliar with the school system, one thing is consistent whichever school I attend: Math. Having a few number of possessions is just practical.

## My current residency

I now spend 2/3 of my time in Melbourne as I attend the University of Melbourne. The remaining 1/3 is spent living with my family in Tokyo during periods of school break.

No, this is not satire.

No, I do not work at Netflix btw, with four children and a beautiful wife.

And no, I'm certainly not a massochist who takes joy in torturing themselves.

But yes, I happen to run Arch and not have a girlfriend.

## Why do all this?

It all started when I saw [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen) moving fast in Vim. I couldn't even process what was going on, but it looked cool, and from that moment on I was intrigued. [write more](). I started with learning Vim motions, and eventually transitioned to Neovim.

But it wasn't only Vim that had captivated my attention. ThePrimeagen was consuming more and more of the time I was dedicating to watching YouTube. Eventually I stumbled upon one of his article read videos [How To Get Into Software](https://youtu.be/ijQvgERWKjA?si=zfVB-fnBYaaEwcNu). In it, the blog author writes using Arch as the first step.

I too, would like to be able to say the equivalent of "I work at Netflix btw" or "I have four children and a beautiful wife", although I'm still trying to figure out what that would constitute for me.

That's why I'm choosing to do things the "hard way".

There are ways to spend my time to likely improve my immediate employability. Like learning Java or Go instead of Rust. Reallocating the time I spend learning about text editors and operating systems to doing more LeetCode. But I'm in it for the long run. And I enjoy these "unproductive" anyways things, so it's a win for me whether the knowledge and experience I gain from them will make me more employable in the future.

Thank you to ThePrimeagen, for not only entertaining me, but also helping me enjoy programming even more.

There has already been observable secondary effects.

Change in attitude towards learning.

Ex: 
using Vim 
--> less scared of Terminal/CLI 
--> wouldn't it be cool if I could do more via the Terminal?
--> I wonder if I can do my Git stuff with CLI commands
--> learn how Git works on a fundamental basis

Maybe I'll never use Rust professionally.

Maybe I'll go back to VSCode.

Maybe I'll go back to daily-driving macOS.

But dang it, I'm going to be sipping that soy latte with more skills and knowledge than the other JR Devs. And when I'm 60 with a white beard, I'll be yelling at the young JRs that they've never programmed the real way. Or maybe Rust will have been adopted by the industry and it won't be much of a flex, and maybe the year of the Linux desktop will have finally come. Or maybe AI will have made computing by humans obsolete and there won't be any young JRs to flex on.

I don't know whether learning Rust, Vim, or Arch will make you a better programmer, or more employable. But I can give you a personal guarantee that the last one will work wonders in keeping you without a partner.

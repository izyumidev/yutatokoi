No, this is not satire.

No, I do not work at Netflix btw, with four children and a beautiful wife.

And no, I'm certainly not a massochist who takes joy in torturing themselves.

But yes, running Arch does mean I have no girlfriend.

## Why do all this?

It all started when I saw [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen) moving fast in Vim. I couldn't even process what was going on, but it looked cool, and from that moment on I was intrigued. [write more](). I started with learning Vim motions, and eventually transitioned to Neovim.

But it wasn't only Vim that had captivated my attention. ThePrimeagen was consuming more and more of the time I was dedicating to watching YouTube. Eventually I stumbled upon one of his article read videos [How To Get Into Software](https://youtu.be/ijQvgERWKjA?si=zfVB-fnBYaaEwcNu). In it, the blog author writes using Arch as the first step.

I too, would like to be able to say the equivalent of "I work at Netflix btw" or "I have four children and a beautiful wife", although I'm still trying to figure out what that would constitute for me.

That's why I'm choosing to do things the "hard way".

There are ways to spend my time to likely improve my immediate employability. Like learning Java or Go instead of Rust. Using VSCode instead of Neovim. Running macOS or Windows instead of Arch. But I'm in it for the long run. And I enjoy these "unproductive" anyways things, so it's a win for me whether the knowledge and experience I gain from them will make me more employable in the future.

Thank you to ThePrimeagen, for not only entertaining me, but also helping me enjoy programming even more.

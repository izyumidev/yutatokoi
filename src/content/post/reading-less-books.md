- Used to read 50+ books a year
- Current hypothesis: reading deeper, making sure to understand the content is better. Remembering the content/putting it to use is why we read non-fiction in the first place.

I used to read 50+ books a year, about one book a week. Focusing on quantity over quality has its benefits, but reversing the priorities I think, is more beneficial for me currently.

## Quantity over quality

Reading one book a week was something I deliberately chose to do,

## Quality over quantity

Although I don't own many things, physical books were the one thing I had lots of. When it came for me to choose let go of most physical books, I picked up each book and thought about what I had learned from it. For most of the books, I had a vague idea of the key arguments, but nearly none of the specifics.

Then I thought to myself: "Isn't the whole point I'm reading all these books to remember the contents or put the ideas to use?". 

Most books just don't stick when you don't engage with them deeply. Focusing on quantity and aiming to achieve a high count of books read in a year didn't allow me to engage with each one deeply.

Imagine a programmer/CS student that completely rejects caffeine consumption. I know, impossible right?

I haven't had caffeine for over four years at this point, at least not intentionally.

Most people take caffeine to stay awake and be able to focus at a task, such as programming. I find that for me, caffeine is counterproductive in this regard.

## Sensitive to caffeine

I'm quite sensitive to caffeine, which means the same amount of it will have more of an effect on me than most other people. I also crash heavier than most other people I feel.

When caffeine is working its magic, I certainly did feel an improvement in focus, but when considering the quality of focus on a longer time span, it's destructive for me.

## Dependency

Caffeine dependency is scary. It not only gets expensive, but you become unreliable without caffeine. That's another thing you have to take care of in order to function.

I get quite particular about the things I use on a daily basis. But I'm not good at managing lots of things. Having a particular way of drinking caffeine just adds one more thing I have to manage, which I would probably poorly do, then my particular preferences wouldn't be satisfied.

## Social situations

At least in Japan, it's quite common to be offered coffee or tea in social settings. This can sometimes still be a little bit hard to deal with. Although there are more places serving decaf, it's not always the case. Whenever decaf is not an option, I really do prefer to just drink water, and not even some other drinks like juice. But when I ask for water, I usually get a worried or confused look. Please let me know if you have better ways to deal with this.

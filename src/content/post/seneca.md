Unequal distribution of food and hunger. People wearing jewellery worth a small fortune. Individuals ending their life once they feel fully prepared to live it.

Those are all examples of problems and problematic people described by Seneca the Younger, specifically in the essays “On the Shortness of Life”, "On the Tranquility of Mind", "On the Happy Life". 

Whether these are considered problems is perhaps up to the personal values of the reader. However, I had thought many of these were a symptom of modern day society. Many people around me seem to hold a similar view. Maybe it is because people feel too safe and assured of a future that is awaiting, that they prolong living out their life, always trying to prepare for it.

Yet, here is a person writing over 2,000 years ago of the presence of the exact same phenomena. When life expectancy was much shorter, and when one would have much less assurance that there will be a tomorrow.

Perhaps these phenomena are not present because of the unique circumstances of modern day society. Perhaps it is much more deeply rooted in humans and society.

To oversimplify Seneca's coping mechanisms to these problems is as follows: "Study philosophy man, it'll solve all your problems!". While I don't agree with the solutions, the issues that Seneca brings up captivated my attention. It is what led me to read the book twice more, after completing it my first time.

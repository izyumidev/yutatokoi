Unequal distribution of food and hunger. People wearing jewellery worth a small fortune. Individuals ending their life only once they had just felt fully prepared to live it.

Those are all examples of problems and problematic people described by Seneca the Younger, specifically in the essays “On the Shortness of Life”, "On the Tranquility of Mind", "On the Happy Life".

Whether these are considered as problems is perhaps up to the personal values of the reader. However, I had certainly thought many of these were as a symptom of modern day society. Many people around me seem to hold a similar view. Perhaps it is because people today feel too safe and assured of a future that is awaiting, that they prolong living out their life, always trying to prepare for it.

Yet, here is a person over 2,000 years ago writing of the presence of the exact same phenomena. At a time when life expectancy was much shorter, and when one could have much less confidence that there will be a tomorrow.

Perhaps these phenomena are not present because of the unique circumstances of modern day society. Perhaps it is much more deeply rooted in humans and society.

To oversimplify Seneca's solutions to these problems is as follows: "Study philosophy man, it'll solve all your problems!". While I don't agree with the solutions and many of the details, the large issues that Seneca brings up captivated my attention. It is what led me to read the book twice more, after completing it my first time.

I read many books, but not many are read multiple times. Maybe this is an indicator that there lies good ideas in this one, worth savoring and considering.

From outerwear to underwear, everything I wear is black. In fact there are even people in real life who know me as the person who only wears black. I've done this for over 4 years now, since around the fall of 2019.

In fact my clothes aren't just all black. It's the same outfit every single day.

## Why the same clothes everyday?

Thinking about what to wear for the day's occasion, how each item goes with others to create one cohesive look can be fun, and I enjoyed doing so for a few years.

But after hearing that Steve Jobs only wore the same clothes everyday to reduce the number of decisions he makes in a day, I wanted to try it out myself.

This change did in fact free me from the nontrivial time and energy I sometimes spent to choose what clothes to wear, what new clothes to buy. That was enough to make this temporary test to a permanent change. That's it really.

## So then why black?

I do enjoy picking out clothes and an outfit, but I don't like it when I spend too much time on it, getting in the way of other things in my life. But if each piece of clothing is black, they all work together, reducing a dimension that I have to consider. Having a strict rule like this makes searching for clothes easier as well.

I would love it if I could wear for example a white shirt or grey shoes. But they just take too much time and care to maintain looking clean.

I buy multiple of the same clothing at once, so they all show wear and tear at around the same time. Once they do get old, I donate or recycle them and only then, look for replacements.

One of the things I'm known for in real life is that I only wear black. I've done this for over 4 years now, since around the fall of 2019.

## Why only black?

- Don't want to use my mental resources thinking about clothes
- When eventually getting new clothes, having a strict rule makes the choice easy
- If each piece is black, they all work together
- Black shows stains the least

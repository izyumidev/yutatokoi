School days and work days premise on people being at school/work for around eight hours a day. But I can't give my best focus for half of those hours. Focusing intensely on an intellectually demanding work or doing an emotionally taxing task takes up a lot of energy. For me, if I am really 向き合ってる with them, I have at best four hours on any given day that I can spend on those tasks.

I'm not sure how other people work for eight hours when I can only do four.

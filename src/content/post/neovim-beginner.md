I've taken two university courses, each using Python and Racket. I occasionally make automation scripts and tools in Python, and [solving Advent of Code problems](https://github.com/yutatokoi/aoc).

Most people would recommend someone at my stage to use VSCode. Then why do I use Neovim?

The main reason is that unlearning habits is difficult. (The other reason I use Neovim: because it's cool and I can say "I use neovim btw")

When I started playing basketball, I shot using both hands. However, the consensus is that shooting with just one hand is better for shooting accuracy and consistency. But one-handed shooting is not only unintuitive as a beginner, but also hard to get enough power with to shoot from longer distances. So, only once I started taking basketball and shooting more seriously, did I train to shoot one-handed. Now, I am a pretty good shooter, and I even get compliments about the cleanliness of my shooting form.

Should I have started with one-handed shooting from the very beginning? Probably not. It would've likely not let me have as much fun with basketball, meaning I don't develop as much of an interest, not playing and practicing enough to improve to where I am today.

Training wheels are certainly important, but taking them off as soon as possible is critical, especially while there are low stakes.

I'm not programming at a job, where I can't afford to take weeks to learn to code through just the Terminal. Instead, I'm a student with all the free time to learn.

I don't yet know all of the benefits of learning to code with Vim/Neovim, or even understand how to use it well. I only know the bare basics: getting to and from insert/normal mode, `hjkl` movement keys. That is all I really needed to get started, and I'm slowly learning more things as I desire them: `dd` to delete a line, `y` to yank, `p` to paste, `u` to undo...

There's no consensus that actively using Vim/Neovim is the best, but I've heard enough people like [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen/featured) say that learning how to use it will at the very least make you a better programmer. Common arguments are: "Vim movements are fast and useful everywhere", "it's lightweight and minimal", "it forces you to learn how programming works on a more fundamental level".

Even at this very early stage of adoption, I've already found that not having to touch my mouse makes me faster. I'm not sure if I'll stick with Vim/Neovim for the rest of my life, but I am enjoying using it so far, and will hopefully be a better programmer coming out of this.
